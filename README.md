##﻿# Fibonacci Series:
 
📝 Explanation:
a and b start as 0 and 1, the first two Fibonacci numbers.

The loop runs n times, printing a each time.

It calculates the next term as a + b, then updates a and b.

### 🔢 **What is the Fibonacci Series?**

The **Fibonacci series** is a sequence of numbers where **each number is the sum of the two numbers before it**.

It starts like this:

```
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...
```

### 🧮 **How it works:**

* Start with **0** and **1**.
* Then, add those two numbers: 0 + 1 = **1**
* Next, add the last two: 1 + 1 = **2**
* Then, 1 + 2 = **3**
* Then, 2 + 3 = **5**
* And so on…

So the rule is:

> **Each new number = the sum of the previous two numbers**

### 🔁 **Formula:**

Mathematically, it looks like this:

$$
F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)
$$

Where:

* $F(0) = 0$
* $F(1) = 1$

### 🌿 **Where is it used?**

The Fibonacci series appears in many natural and human-made systems, such as:

* **Nature**: The arrangement of leaves, petals, and seeds.
* **Art & Architecture**: Linked to the **golden ratio**.
* **Computer Science**: Used in algorithms, search techniques, and recursion problems.
* **Finance**: Some traders use Fibonacci ratios to predict stock movements.

#### The do-while loop executes the code block at least once, even if the condition is false initially.
Explanation:
The do-while loop always executes the code block at least once because it checks the condition after the first iteration
